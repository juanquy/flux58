3. **Create Project Page**

   - Corrected references to username variables in formatted strings
   - Resolved 500 Internal Server Error when admin users log in

## Technical Changes

### Editor Page Fixes

The editor page had issues with string formatting patterns that caused 500 errors:

```python
# Original code with format string errors
logger.info("Loading editor for project_id: {project_id}, user_id: {}".format(user_id))
print("Project loaded for editor - ID: {project_id}, Name: {}".format(project.get('name')))

# Fixed code with correct formatter positioning
logger.info("Loading editor for project_id: {}, user_id: {}".format(project_id, user_id))
print("Project loaded for editor - ID: {}, Name: {}".format(project_id, project.get('name')))
```

### Dashboard Template Fix

The dashboard template rendering had an awkward structure that could cause the `landing_page_settings` parameter to be incorrectly parsed:

```python
# Original code with awkward placement
return render_template(
    'dashboard.html',
    projects=projects,
    credits=user_credits,
    exports=exports,
    activities=activities,
    transactions=transactions
, landing_page_settings=get_landing_page_settings())

# Fixed code with proper parameter placement
return render_template(
    'dashboard.html',
    projects=projects,
    credits=user_credits,
    exports=exports,
    activities=activities,
    transactions=transactions,
    landing_page_settings=get_landing_page_settings())
```

### Create Project Page Fixes

All render_template calls in the create_project_page function were updated to include the landing_page_settings parameter:

```python
# Original - missing landing_page_settings in some paths
return render_template('create_project.html')

# Fixed - all paths include landing_page_settings
return render_template('create_project.html', landing_page_settings=get_landing_page_settings())
```

### Admin Dashboard Fixes

Fixed string formatting in the admin dashboard recent activity section that was causing 500 errors:

```python
# Original code with incorrect variable reference
recent_activity.append({
    "icon": "bi-film",
    "description": "{username} created project: {}".format(project['name']),
    "time": format_timestamp(project['created_at'])
})

# Fixed code with correct variable reference
recent_activity.append({
    "icon": "bi-film",
    "description": "{} created project: {}".format(username, project['name']),
    "time": format_timestamp(project['created_at'])
})
```

Similar fix was applied to the export activity description formatting.

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the fix script from the application directory:

```bash
cd /root/OpenShot/test_app
python3 credits_and_editor_fix.py
```

2. Restart the Flask application:

```bash
# Stop any running instances
pkill -f "python.*flux58.py"

# Start with the launcher script
cd /root/OpenShot
./run_flux58.sh
```

## Verification

After applying the fix:

1. Login as a test user
2. Verify user credits are displayed correctly on the dashboard
3. Create a new project and verify you can access the editor without errors
4. Navigate through the application to verify consistent styling across all pages
