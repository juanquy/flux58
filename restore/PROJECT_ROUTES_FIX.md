# Project Routes Fix - FLUX58 Web Application

## Problems Fixed

### 1. "Internal Server Error" when Viewing Project Details or Editor
When attempting to view project details or open the editor, users would encounter a 500 Internal Server Error. This occurred because the route handlers for `/projects/<project_id>` and `/editor` were missing or incorrectly implemented.

### 2. Missing Project Deletion Feature
The application had UI elements for deleting projects (buttons and modals in both the projects list and project details pages), but the corresponding route handler was missing, making it impossible to delete projects.

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Route Handlers**: 
   - The route for `/projects/<project_id>/delete` was missing entirely
   - The route for `/projects/<project_id>` lacked proper error handling
   - The route for `/editor` was missing or improperly implemented

2. **Ineffective Error Handling**:
   - No try/except blocks in route handlers to catch and gracefully handle database errors
   - No validation of project existence before attempting operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Project Deletion Route
```python
@app.route('/projects/<project_id>/delete', methods=['POST'])
def delete_project(project_id):
    """Delete a project"""
    if 'user_id' not in session:
        flash('Please log in to delete projects', 'warning')
        return redirect(url_for('login_page'))
    
    user_id = session['user_id']
    
    try:
        project = project_manager.get_project(project_id)
        
        if not project:
            flash('Project not found', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
        
        # Check if user owns the project or is admin
        if project['user_id'] != user_id and session.get('role') != 'admin':
            flash('Access denied', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
        
        # Delete the project
        success = project_manager.delete_project(project_id)
        
        if success:
            flash('Project deleted successfully', 'success')
        else:
            flash('Failed to delete project', 'danger')
        
        return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error deleting project: {str(e)}")
        flash('An error occurred while deleting the project', 'danger')
        return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
```

### 2. Fixed Project Details Route
Enhanced the project details route with proper error handling:

```python
@app.route('/projects/<project_id>')
def project_details(project_id):
    """View project details"""
    if 'user_id' not in session:
        flash('Please log in to view project details', 'warning')
        return redirect(url_for('login_page'))
    
    user_id = session['user_id']
    
    try:
        # Get project from database
        project = project_manager.get_project(project_id)
        
        if not project:
            flash('Project not found', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
        
        # Check if user owns the project or is admin
        if project['user_id'] != user_id and session.get('role') != 'admin':
            flash('Access denied', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
        
        # Get user credits
        user_credits = db.get_user_credits(user_id) or {"total": 0, "used": 0}
        available_credits = user_credits["total"] - user_credits["used"]
        
        return render_template(
            'project_details.html', 
            project=project,
            credits=available_credits
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error getting project details: {str(e)}")
        flash('An error occurred while loading project details', 'danger')
        return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
```

### 3. Fixed Editor Route
Added proper error handling and access control:

```python
@app.route('/editor')
def editor_page():
    """Video editor page"""
    if 'user_id' not in session:
        flash('Please log in to access the editor', 'warning')
        return redirect(url_for('login_page'))
    
    project_id = request.args.get('project_id')
    if not project_id:
        flash('Project ID is required', 'danger')
        return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
    
    user_id = session['user_id']
    
    try:
        # Get project from database
        project = project_manager.get_project(project_id)
        
        if not project:
            flash('Project not found', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
        
        # Check if user owns the project or is admin
        if project['user_id'] != user_id and session.get('role') != 'admin':
            flash('Access denied', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
        
        # Get user credits
        user_credits = db.get_user_credits(user_id) or {"total": 0, "used": 0}
        available_credits = user_credits["total"] - user_credits["used"]
        
        return render_template(
            'editor.html', 
            project=project,
            credits=available_credits
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading editor: {str(e)}")
        flash('An error occurred while loading the editor', 'danger')
        return redirect(url_for('projects_page'))
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Added try/except blocks to all route handlers
   - Detailed error logging to help with debugging
   - User-friendly flash messages instead of internal server errors

2. **Enhanced Access Control**:
   - Consistent session validation across all routes
   - Proper ownership/permission checking for projects

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Check that projects exist before operations
   - Validate required parameters

4. **User Experience**:
   - Appropriate redirects when errors occur
   - Information messages via flash notifications
   - Consistent flow between pages

## Verification

The changes were tested by:
1. Creating projects as a regular user
2. Viewing project details
3. Opening projects in the editor
4. Deleting projects
5. Attempting to access projects owned by other users

All operations now work as expected, with proper error handling and user-friendly messages.
