# Project Fixes - FLUX58 Web Application

## Database Inconsistency Fix

### Issues Fixed

1. **PostgreSQL vs SQLite Database Inconsistency**: 
   The main application was using PostgreSQL correctly, but the ProjectManager class was initializing its own separate SQLite database connection. This caused project creation to fail with "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable" because:
   - User authentication was happening in PostgreSQL
   - Project creation was attempting to use a different SQLite database
   - Foreign key constraints failed when trying to create a project for a user that didn't exist in SQLite

2. **Missing Project Routes**:
   The application had templates for project creation but was missing some key routes:
   - `/projects/new` for creating new projects
   - `/projects/<project_id>` for viewing project details
   - `/editor` for the video editor interface

### Implemented Solutions

1. **Database Connection Sharing**:
   - Modified app.py to share the PostgreSQL database connection with the projects module
   - Updated ProjectManager to check multiple places for a database connection:
     1. Check module globals
     2. Check if the module itself has a db attribute (set from app.py)
     3. Fall back to SQLite only if no other connection is provided
   - Added informative logging about which database type is being used

2. **Project Routes Addition**:
   - Added route handlers for project-related functionality:
     - `/projects` - Lists all user projects
     - `/projects/new` - Form for creating new projects
     - `/projects/<project_id>` - Views details of a specific project
     - `/editor` - Video editor interface for a project
   - Implemented proper permissions checking for all routes
   - Added error handling with friendly error messages

3. **Flask Session Improvements**:
   - Added permanent secret key storage in a file
   - Set session lifetime to 7 days for better user experience
   - Made sessions permanent by default
   - Added more robust error handling in session management

### Verification Process

1. User Login:
   - Verified admin user can log in and is redirected to admin dashboard
   - Verified regular user can log in and is redirected to user dashboard
   - Confirmed session cookies are set correctly with appropriate expiration

2. Project Creation:
   - Tested project creation with test user
   - Confirmed project data is saved in PostgreSQL
   - Verified redirect to editor after project creation

3. Database Consistency:
   - Confirmed ProjectManager is using PostgreSQL database
   - Verified objects are created in the same database where user authentication happens

### Files Modified

1. `/home/juanquy/OpenShot/test_app/app.py`:
   - Added imports for projects module
   - Made db instance available to projects module
   - Added project management routes

2. `/home/juanquy/OpenShot/test_app/projects.py`:
   - Enhanced database connection logic
   - Added better error handling
   - Improved logging

3. Created supporting scripts:
   - `fix_project_creation.py` - Initial database fix script
   - `fix_flask_sessions.py` - Session management improvements
   - `add_project_routes.py` - Added missing routes
   - `test_project_creation.py` - Testing script

### Future Recommendations

1. **Dependency Injection**:
   Consider refactoring to properly inject dependencies like database connections rather than using globals or module attributes. This would make the code more maintainable and testable.

2. **Application Factory Pattern**:
   Consider using Flask's application factory pattern for better organization and to allow for different configurations (development, testing, production).

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   Add more robust error handling and user-friendly error messages throughout the application.

4. **Testing Framework**:
   Implement automated tests for critical functionality to catch similar issues early.

5. **Consistent Logging**:
   Enhance logging throughout the application for better troubleshooting capabilities.

## Notes

These fixes ensure that all components of the application use the same database connection, maintaining data consistency across the system. The application now follows a more logical flow where users can create projects, access the editor, and view project details seamlessly.
