## Credit Usage

AI features use your account credits based on the complexity and duration of the process:

| AI Feature | Credits Per Minute of Content |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Smart Upscaling | 2-8 (depending on target resolution) |
| Video Restoration | 3-5 |
| Color Enhancement | 1-3 |
| Audio Cleanup | 1-2 |
| Text-to-Speech | 3 |
| Music Creation | 5 |
| Text2Video Generation | 10-20 |
| Image2Video | 8-15 |
| Caption Generation | 2 |
| Smart Video Analysis | 3 |
| Automatic Editing | 5-10 |

Notes:
