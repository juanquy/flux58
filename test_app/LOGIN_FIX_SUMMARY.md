# Login Issue Resolution - FLUX58 Web Application

## Problem Summary
The login system was not properly redirecting users after successful authentication. When attempting to log in as admin (admin123) or as a regular user (test/test123), the application would stay on the login page, clearing the username and password fields instead of redirecting to the appropriate dashboard.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Flask Secret Key Issue** - The application was using a dynamically generated secret key on each restart, which invalidated existing session cookies.

2. **Session Persistence** - Sessions were not explicitly marked as permanent, which means they were only valid for the browser session.

3. **Session Lifetime** - No explicit session lifetime was set, so sessions would expire based on Flask's default settings.

4. **Service Configuration** - The production service file was missing the proper PostgreSQL database environment variables.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Permanent Secret Key

Created a persistent secret key stored in a file:
- Generated a strong 64-character secret key
- Stored in `.flask_secret_key` file
- Modified `app.py` to load the key from this file
- If the file is unavailable, falls back to a dynamic key with warning

### 2. Session Permanence

Added code to mark all sessions as permanent by default:
```python
@app.before_request
def make_session_permanent():
    session.permanent = True
```

### 3. Session Lifetime

Set a 7-day expiration for all sessions:
```python
from datetime import timedelta
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(days=7)
```

### 4. Service Configuration

Updated the systemd service file (`/etc/systemd/system/openshot-web.service`) to include all necessary environment variables:
- Added `DB_TYPE=postgres`
- Added PostgreSQL connection details
- Applied the configuration using `systemctl daemon-reload`

## Verification

Created and ran a test script (`test_login.py`) that verifies:
1. Admin login successfully redirects to `/admin`
2. Regular user login successfully redirects to `/dashboard`  
3. Session cookies are properly set with appropriate expiration
4. Logout functionality works correctly

## Additional Tools Created

1. **debug_login.py** - Diagnostic script that checks:
   - Database connection
   - User credentials and password hashes
   - Session table structure and existing sessions
   - Flask app configuration for sessions
   - Validates route definitions

2. **fix_flask_sessions.py** - Automated fix script that:
   - Creates a permanent secret key
   - Updates app.py with session configuration fixes
   - Backs up the original app.py file
   - Gives instructions for service update

## Preventive Measures

1. **Environment Variables** - All database connection parameters are now properly set in the service file.

2. **Permanent Secret Key** - The secret key is now stored in a file and persists across application restarts.

3. **Consistent Session Handling** - Sessions are now permanent with a defined 7-day lifetime.

4. **Testing Scripts** - Left test scripts in place to help diagnose any similar issues in the future.

## Notes for Future Maintenance

1. The `.flask_secret_key` file should be backed up when creating system backups.

2. If this file is lost or corrupted, a new one will be automatically created, but all users will need to log in again.

3. The session lifetime is set to 7 days. This can be adjusted in app.py if needed.

4. Always ensure the service file at `/etc/systemd/system/openshot-web.service` has the correct environment variables when making system changes.

5. Use the test scripts as diagnostic tools if similar issues arise in the future.
