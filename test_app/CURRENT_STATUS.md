2. Enhanced user management capabilities
3. Better payment history and management interface
4. Improved system diagnostics and logs viewing

After completing the admin panel improvements, we'll move on to enhancing the user interface and editor experience.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- NEVER rename the application. The app must remain in its current structure
- When testing new features, create separate test files but preserve the main application
- Always update the main app directly after verifying functionality
- Delete any test files once they are no longer needed
- Maintain the original file structure and naming convention

## Working Environment
- Current backups are in: `/home/juanquy/OpenShot/test_app/backups/20250319/`
- Original app backup: `/home/juanquy/OpenShot/test_app/saved_backups/app.py.original`
- Enhanced setup script: `/home/juanquy/OpenShot/setupOS_enhanced.sh`
- Setup improvements documentation: `/home/juanquy/OpenShot/test_app/SETUP_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- Main launcher: `/home/juanquy/OpenShot/test_app/flux58.py`

## How to Resume Development
1. Start the application using:
   ```
   cd /root/OpenShot/test_app
   source venv/bin/activate
   python flux58.py
   ```

   If port 5000 is in use:
   ```
   PORT=5001 python flux58.py
   ```

2. Access the admin interface at http://localhost:5000/admin with:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin123

3. PostgreSQL database details:
   - Database: `flux58`
   - User: `flux58_user`
   - Password: `flux58_password`
   - Host: `localhost`
   - Port: `5432`

4. Make sure to test any changes with Python 3.8 or newer
