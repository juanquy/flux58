# FLUX58 AI Media Labs - AI Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview

Based on our analysis of the current codebase, the FLUX58 platform aims to integrate advanced AI capabilities powered by OpenShot, LTX-Video, and custom implementations. Here's the architectural overview:

## 1. LTX-Video Integration

The LTX-Video library (`/root/OpenShot/LTX-Video/`) provides Text-to-Video capabilities:

- **Core Components**:
  - `inference.py`: Main entry point for text-to-video generation
  - `pipeline_ltx_video.py`: The pipeline that handles text prompts, conditioning, and generation
  - Neural models: Transformer3D, VAE, etc. for latent manipulation

- **Integration Plan**:
  - Create a Python API wrapper to expose LTX-Video functionality to Flask app
  - Implement a queue system for processing generation requests
  - Add credit-based usage tracking system

## 2. AI Features Implementation

Based on the documented features in `AI_FEATURES.md`, we need to implement:

### Video Enhancement
- Smart Upscaling (increase resolution up to 4x)
- Video Restoration (noise reduction, stabilization)
- Color Enhancement (auto color grading, style transfer)

### Audio Processing
- Audio Cleanup (noise reduction, voice enhancement)
- Audio Generation (Text-to-Speech, music creation)

### Content Generation
- Text2Video (generate video clips from text descriptions)
- Image2Video (transform still images into moving video)
- Caption Generation (automatic transcription)

### Intelligent Editing
- Smart Video Analysis (scene detection, content tagging)
- Automatic Editing (smart cuts, pacing analysis)
- Intelligent Suggestions (edit recommendations)

## 3. Web Interface Integration

The editor UI already has placeholders for AI features:

- AI Assistant panel in properties sidebar
- AI tools section in media library
- AI Assist button in header

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend AI Infrastructure
1. Create `ai_processing.py` for task handling and queue management
2. Implement a REST API for AI operations
3. Set up credit usage tracking

### Phase 2: LTX-Video Integration
1. Create wrapper around LTX-Video's inference pipeline
2. Implement media storage for generated content
3. Add progress tracking for long-running operations

### Phase 3: Simple AI Features
1. Implement audio cleanup and enhancement
2. Add basic video enhancement features
3. Create caption generation

### Phase 4: Advanced AI Features
1. Implement Text2Video generation
2. Add Image2Video animation
3. Integrate intelligent editing suggestions

### Phase 5: UI Integration
1. Connect frontend components to backend AI APIs
2. Add real-time processing indicators
3. Implement AI chat assistant

## 5. Credit System

Implement a credit-based system as described in `AI_FEATURES.md`:

| AI Feature | Credits Per Minute of Content |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Smart Upscaling | 2-8 (depending on target resolution) |
| Video Restoration | 3-5 |
| Color Enhancement | 1-3 |
| Audio Cleanup | 1-2 |
| Text-to-Speech | 3 |
| Music Creation | 5 |
| Text2Video Generation | 10-20 |
| Image2Video | 8-15 |
| Caption Generation | 2 |
| Smart Video Analysis | 3 |
| Automatic Editing | 5-10 |

## 6. Technical Requirements

### Hardware
- IBM POWER8 architecture support
- NVIDIA P100 GPU compatibility
- High memory requirements for model inference

### Software Dependencies
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- LTX-Video library
- OpenShot integration
- FFMPEG for video processing

## 7. Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with required dependencies
2. Create basic AI API wrapper for LTX-Video
3. Implement credit tracking system
4. Add simple AI features (audio/video enhancement)
5. Connect frontend UI components to backend
